"""
The IBM models are a series of generative models that learn lexical
translation probabilities, p(target language word|source language word),
given a sentence-aligned parallel corpus.

The models increase in sophistication from model 1 to 5. Typically, the
output of lower models is used to seed the higher models. All models
use the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to learn various
probability tables.

Words in a sentence are one-indexed. The first word of a sentence has
position 1, not 0. Index 0 is reserved in the source sentence for the
NULL token. The concept of position does not apply to NULL, but it is
indexed at 0 by convention.

Each target word is aligned to exactly one source word or the NULL
token.

Notations
i: Position in the source sentence
    Valid values are 0 (for NULL), 1, 2, ..., length of source sentence
j: Position in the target sentence
    Valid values are 1, 2, ..., length of target sentence
l: Number of words in the source sentence, excluding NULL
m: Number of words in the target sentence
s: A word in the source language
t: A word in the target language
phi: Fertility, the number of target words produced by a source word
p1: Probability that a target word produced by a source word is
    accompanied by another target word that is aligned to NULL
p0: 1 - p1

IBM Model 3 improves on Model 2 by directly modeling the phenomenon
where a word in one language may be translated into zero or more words
in another. This is expressed by the fertility probability,
n(phi | source word).

If a source word translates into more than one word, it is possible to
generate sentences that have the same alignment in multiple ways. This
is modeled by a distortion step. The distortion probability, d(j|i,l,m),
predicts a target word position, given its aligned source word's
position. The distortion probability replaces the alignment probability
of Model 2.

The fertility probability is not applicable for NULL. Target words that
align to NULL are assumed to be distributed uniformly in the target
sentence. The existence of these words is modeled by p1, the probability
that a target word produced by a real source word requires another
target word that is produced by NULL.

The EM algorithm used in Model 3 is:
E step - In the training data, collect counts, weighted by prior
         probabilities.
         (a) count how many times a source language word is translated
             into a target language word
         (b) count how many times a particular position in the target
             sentence is aligned to a particular position in the source
             sentence
         (c) count how many times a source word is aligned to phi number
             of target words
         (d) count how many times NULL is aligned to a target word

M step - Estimate new probabilities based on the counts from the E step

Because there are too many possible alignments, only the most probable
ones are considered. First, the best alignment is determined using prior
probabilities. Then, a hill climbing approach is used to find other good
candidates.
