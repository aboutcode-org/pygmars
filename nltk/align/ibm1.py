"""
The IBM models are a series of generative models that learn lexical
translation probabilities, p(target language word|source language word),
given a sentence-aligned parallel corpus.

The models increase in sophistication from model 1 to 5. Typically, the
output of lower models is used to seed the higher models. All models
use the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to learn various
probability tables.

Words in a sentence are one-indexed. The first word of a sentence has
position 1, not 0. Index 0 is reserved in the source sentence for the
NULL token. The concept of position does not apply to NULL, but it is
indexed at 0 by convention.

Each target word is aligned to exactly one source word or the NULL
token.

Notations
i: Position in the source sentence
    Valid values are 0 (for NULL), 1, 2, ..., length of source sentence
j: Position in the target sentence
    Valid values are 1, 2, ..., length of target sentence
s: A word in the source language
t: A word in the target language


In IBM Model 1, word order is ignored for simplicity. Thus, the
following two alignments are equally likely.

Source: je mange du jambon
Target: i eat some ham
Alignment: (1,1) (2,2) (3,3) (4,4)

Source: je mange du jambon
Target: some ham eat i
Alignment: (1,4) (2,3) (3,2) (4,1)

The EM algorithm used in Model 1 is:
E step - In the training data, count how many times a source language
         word is translated into a target language word, weighted by
         the prior probability of the translation.

M step - Estimate the new probability of translation based on the
         counts from the Expectation step.
