    "## First Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to collect data from Twitter, you first need to register a new *application* &mdash; this is Twitter's way of referring to any computer program that interacts with the Twitter API. As long as you save your registration information correctly, you should only need to do this once, since the information should work for any NLTK code that you write. You will need to have a Twitter account before you can register. Twitter also insists that [you add a mobile phone number to your Twitter profile](https://support.twitter.com/articles/110250-adding-your-mobile-number-to-your-account-via-web) before you will be allowed to register an application.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the steps you need to carry out.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting your API keys from Twitter\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sign in to your Twitter account at https://apps.twitter.com. You should then get sent to a screen that looks something like this:\n",
    "<img src=\"images/twitter_app1.tiff\" width=\"600px\">\n",
    "Clicking on the **Create New App** button should take you to the following screen:\n",
    "<img src=\"images/twitter_app2.tiff\" width=\"600px\">\n",
    "The information that you provide for **Name**, **Description** and **Website** can be anything you like.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Make sure that you select **Read and Write** access for your application (as specified on the *Permissions* tab of Twitter's Application Management screen):\n",
    "<img src=\"images/twitter_app3.tiff\" width=\"600px\">\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Go to the tab labeled **Keys and Access Tokens**. It should look something like this, but with actual keys rather than a string of Xs:\n",
    "<img src=\"images/twitter_app4.png\" width=\"650px\">\n",
    "As you can see, this will give you four distinct keys: consumer key, consumer key secret, access token and access token secret.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Storing your keys\n",
    "1. Create a folder named `twitter-files` in your home directory. Within this folder, use a text editor to create a new file called `credentials.txt`. Make sure that this file is just a plain text file. In it, you should create which you should store in a text file with the following structure:\n",
    "```\n",
    "app_key=YOUR CONSUMER KEY  \n",
    "app_secret=YOUR CONSUMER SECRET  \n",
    "oauth_token=YOUR ACCESS TOKEN  \n",
    "oauth_token_secret=YOUR ACCESS TOKEN SECRET\n",
    "```\n",
    "Type the part up to and includinge the '=' symbol exactly as shown. The values on the right-hand side of the '=' &mdash; that is, everything in caps &mdash; should be cut-and-pasted from the relevant API key information shown on the Twitter **Keys and Access Tokens**. Save the file and that's it.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. It's going to be important for NLTK programs to know where you have stored your credentials. We'll assume that this folder is called `twitter-files`, but you can call it anything you like. It's going to be convenient if this folder is also where you save any files containing tweets that you collect. Once you have decided on the name and location of this folder, you will need to set the TWITTER environment variable to this value. For example, on a Unix-like system, you can use something like this:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "export TWITTER=\"/path/to/your/twitter-files\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "On a Windows machine, right click on ‚ÄúMy Computer‚Äù then select `Properties > Advanced > Environment Variables > User Variables > New...` One important thing to remember is that you need to keep your `credentials.txt` file private. So do **not** share your `twitter-files` folder with anyone else, and do not upload it to a public repository such as GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Finally, read through Twitter's [Developer Rules of the Road](https://dev.twitter.com/overview/terms/policy). As far as these rules are concerned, you count as both the application developer and the User.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Install Twython\n",
    "The NLTK Twitter package relies on a third part library called [Twython](https://twython.readthedocs.org/). Install Twython via [pip](https://pip.pypa.io):\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ pip install twython\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "or with [easy_install](https://pythonhosted.org/setuptools/easy_install.html):\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ easy_install twython\n",
    "```\n",
    "We're now ready to get started. The `Twitter` class is a simple way of getting started."

    "*More detail*:\n",
    "Twitter offers are two main authentication options. OAuth 1 is for user-authenticated API calls, and allows sending status updates, direct messages, etc, whereas OAuth 2 is for application-authenticated calls, where read-only access is sufficient. Although OAuth 2 sounds more appropriate for the kind of tasks envisaged within NLTK, it turns out that access to Twitter's streaming API requires OAuth 1, which is why it's necessary to obtain *Read and Write* access for your application."
