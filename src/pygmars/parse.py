"""

This module defines ``Parser`` which is a regular expression-based parser to
parse list of Tokens in a parse tree where each node has a label.

This is originally based on NLTK POS chunk parsing used to identify non-
overlapping linguistic groups (such as base noun phrases) in unrestricted text.

This parsing can identify and group sequences of Tokens in a shallow parse Tree.
A parse Tree is a tree containing Tokens and Trees, where each sub-Tree contains
only Tokens.  For example, the parse Tree for base noun phrase groups in the
sentence "I saw the big dog on the hill" is::

  (SENTENCE:
    (NP: <I>)
    <saw>
    (NP: <the> <big> <dog>)
    <on>
    (NP: <the> <hill>))


Rule
======

``Rule`` uses regular-expressions over Token and Tree labels to parse and group
tokens and trees. The ``parse()`` method constructs a ``ParseString`` that
encodes a particular group of tokens.  Initially, nothing is grouped. ``Rule``
then applies its ``pattern`` substitution to the ``ParseString`` to modify the
token grouping that it encodes. Finally, the ``ParseString`` is transformed back
and returned as a parse Tree.

A ``Rule`` is used to parse a sequence of Tokens and assign a label to a sub-
sequence using a regular expression. Multiple ``Rule``s form a grammar used by a
``Parser``. Many ``Rule``s are typically loaded from a grammar text by a parser.


Rule pattern over labels
-------------------------

A ``pattern`` can update the grouping of tokens and trees by modifying a
``ParseString``. Each ``pattern`` ``apply_transform()`` method modifies the
grouping encoded by a ``ParseString``.

A ``pattern`` uses a modified version of regular expression patterns.  Patterns
are used to match sequence of Token or Tree labels. 
This string contains a sequence of angle-bracket delimited labels (e.g. the
Token or Tree labels), with the grouping indicated by curly braces.
Some examples of encoding label patterns are::

     (<DT>|<JJ>|<NN>)+
     <NN>+
     <NN.*>

    {<DT><JJ><NN>} <VBN><IN> {<DT><NN>} {<DT><NN>} <VBD>

The differences between regular expression patterns and label patterns are:

    - In label patterns, ``'<'`` and ``'>'`` act as parentheses; so
      ``'<NN>+'`` matches one or more repetitions of ``'<NN>'``, not
      ``'<NN'`` followed by one or more repetitions of ``'>'``.

    - Whitespace in label patterns is ignored.  So
      ``'<DT> | <NN>'`` is equivalant to ``'<DT>|<NN>'``

    - In label patterns, ``'.'`` is equivalant to ``'[^{}<>]'``; so
      ``'<NN.*>'`` matches any single label starting with ``'NN'``.

The function ``label_pattern_to_regex`` is used to transform a label pattern to
an equivalent regular expression pattern which is then used internally over the
``ParseString`` encoding.

    Parser is a grammar-based parser that uses a grammar which is a list of Rule
    with patterns that are specialized regular expression for over Token or Tree
    labels. Internally the parsing of a Token and Tree sequence is encoded using
    a ``ParseString``, and each Rule pattern acts by modifying the grouping and
    parsing in the ``ParseString``. Rule patterns are implemented using regular
    expression substitution.

    The Rule patterns of a grammar are executed in sequence.  An earlier pattern
    may introduce a parse boundary that prevents a later pattern from matching.
    Sometimes an individual pattern will match on multiple, overlapping extents
    of the input.  As with regular expression substitution, the parser will
    identify the first match possible, then continue looking for all other
    following matches.

    The maximum depth of a parse tree created by a parser is the same as the
    number of Rules in the grammar.

    When tracing is turned on, the comment portion of a line is displayed each

    tokens. This is the string to which the Rule's pattern regular expression
    transformations are applied. This string contains a sequence of angle-
    bracket delimited labels (e.g. Token or Tree labels), with the grouping

    ``ParseString`` are created from a Tree of Tokens and Trees or list of

    Tokens, nothing is parsed and Tokens are not grouped in a Tree.

    The ``ParseString.apply_transform()`` method uses the Rule label pattern
    "transformer" to transform the backing string and mark which part of that
    string match the Rule pattern. This marking is then used to return a new
